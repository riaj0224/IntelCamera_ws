# UR3 Berry Harvesting Integration

This repository showcases the integration of various technologies, including the UR3 robotic arm, Intel D435F camera, custom-made gripper, and other components for berry harvesting applications. The goal of this project is to develop a robust system that can detect berries, determine their pose, and execute precise gripping and harvesting actions using the UR3 arm.

## :wrench: Technologies Used

The integration project utilizes the following technologies:

- ROS (Robot Operating System) - Noetic version
- RViz - 3D visualization tool for ROS
- RQt - GUI framework for ROS
- ddynamic_reconfigure - Dynamic reconfiguration for ROS
- realsense-ros - ROS packages for Intel RealSense cameras
- aruco_ros - ROS wrapper for ArUco markers


## :file_folder: Project Structure

The workspace structure for the UR3 Berry Harvesting Integration project is as follows:

```
cam_ws/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ devel/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aruco_ros/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ realsense-ros/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ddynamic_reconfigure/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```



- `ur3_ws`: This workspace contains the UR3-specific packages and dependencies required for the robotic arm integration. It includes packages like `universal_robots_ros_driver` and `universal_robot`.

- `cam_ws`: This workspace focuses on camera-related packages and dependencies. It includes packages like `realsense-ros` and `ddynamic_reconfigure`.

## :rocket: Getting Started

To start the integration system, follow these steps:

1. Launch the camera:
```
roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_camera.launch
```

2. Launch the aruco_ros node to detect the identifiable objects:

```
roslaunch aruco_ros single.launch
```

3. Launch the RViz visualization tool using the `example_rviz.launch` file:

```
roslaunch ur_robot_driver example_rviz.launch
```
4. Start the UR3 robot using the ur3_bringup.launch file:
```
roslaunch ur_robot_driver ur3_bringup.launch robot_ip:=<YOUR_ROBOT_IP>
```
5. Run the real_controller_examples.py script to control the vision system, calculate the pose, and execute other relevant actions:
```
rosrun ur_control real_controller_examples.py
```
Ensure that you have correctly configured the IP address of your UR3 robot in the launch file.

## üê≥ Dockerfile

To simplify the setup process, a Dockerfile is provided in the repository. The Dockerfile sets up the necessary environment and installs the required ROS packages and dependencies. It can be used to create a Docker image that encapsulates the entire project's workspace.
